## Apollo3 board of Sparkfun Edge

+ Microcontroller

    - 32-bit **ARM Cortex-M4F** processor with Direct Memory Access
    - 48MHz CPU clock, 96MHz with TurboSPOTâ„¢
    - Extremely low-power usage: 6uA/MHz
    - 1MB Flash
    - 384KB SRAM
    - Dedicated Bluetooth processor with BLE 5

+ Onboard

    - ST LIS2DH12 3-axis accelerometer
    - 2x MEMS microphones with operational amplifier
    - Himax HM01B0 camera connector
    - Qwiic connector
    - 4 x GPIO connections
    - 4 x user LEDs
    - 1 x user button
    - FTDI-style serial header for programming
    - Bluetooth antenna
    - CR2032 coin cell holder for battery operation

+ What It Does
    > High processing to current consumption ratio enables machine learning applications on the 'Edge' of networks, without the need for a central computer or web connection.
    Voice, gesture, or image recognition possible with TensorFlow Lite. (Note: Voice examples are provided. Gesture and image examples hope to be released by TensorFlow soon)

+ General

    - `1.8V ~ 3.6V` supply voltage range
    - Small 1.6in x 1.6in x 0.35in (40.6mm x 40.6mm x 8.9mm) form factor
